How are you actually supposed to do an R project?

I've observed that R has a very different culture than the computer science and software engineering cultures I'm familiar with.

In the latter areas, people often debate preferences for text editors and IDEs, apps and operating systems, and even hardware setups.

With R, though, I got the impression in my time using it that you're basically confined to RStudio.

The documentation also seemed to be very distributed, rather than centralized. After learning the syntax and basics, I did everything by 

I also never really learned how to store my data files. If they were small enough, I could reasonably commit them to GitHub repositories using LFS. Surely, though, others were doing things that required access to databases or SSHing into remote filesystems.

And how about workflow efficiency? Loops almost feel anti-idiomatic, and saving workspaces felt clunky, leaving me to manually re-run each line to load, process, and visualize my data. Using Jupyter Notebooks was also unintuitive me for similar reasons.

Making an aesthetically pleasing graph seemed very difficult, even using ggplot2. But also this is the case in Python's matplotlib too.

I wonder if similar things hold up for other academic-oriented programming software, like MATLAB.

I definitely don't mean to suggest that R (or its users) are inherently inefficient. I learned a lot while using R, but there was a _lot_ I hadn't sought out and learned in terms of optimizing workflow. In fact I think I was working on a Linux boot on a Chromebook, so I had other workflow issues on my mind.

Perhaps I'll leave the bioinformatics to this [other Katherine Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EpZFgfkAAAAJ&hl=en)
