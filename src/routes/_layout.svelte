		<b>About:</b>
		Hi, I’m Kat and this is where I write casually about programming, mostly
		frontend web development and data visualization. I also take computer
		science courses at MIT, where I major in media, and I’m participating in
		<a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>
		in January 2021. Coding first came into my life as a hobby —
		<a href="https://www.katmh.com/girl-in-stem">nurtured</a>
		by Tumblr,
		<a href="https://mahacks.com">hackathons</a>, and
		<a href="https://hackclub.com">hackathon</a>
		<a href="https://aspirations.org">communities</a>
		— and I enjoy approaching it with levity. “Curio” is an imperfect, snappy
		synonym for “knickknack,” which is what I (unabashedly) consider some of my
		side
		<a href="https://katmh.com/projects">projects</a>
		to be. I hope you find something helpful or insightful on these pages :)
